              I'm currently building innovative products at{" "}
              <strong>Flare</strong>, teaming up with some seriously talented
              people to create experiences that bring technology and people
              together in meaningful ways.

              I like to live in the sweet spot between engineering and design â€”
              solving tricky problems under the hood while keeping things
              intuitive, engaging, and enjoyable on the surface. For me, it's
              all about making things that work beautifully and feel great to
              use.

            <p>
              When I'm not glued to a screen, you'll probably find me spending
              time with my wife and three kids, riding my mountain bike, playing
              guitar, listening to music, or watching movies and TV shows.
